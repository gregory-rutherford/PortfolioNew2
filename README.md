# PortfolioNew2

## I wanted to make a portfolio primarily using Flexbox
### There are *a few things* I would like to change in the future.

    1. Change how it responds to mobile
    2. Re-do the project section
    3. Make it a page in which you scroll down for content
    
#### Update!
After adding a few more of my homework projects I realized my portfolio was not scaleable as adding content made it look a bit unseemly. Changed the layout a bit however at this point, I think it would be wise to make a new portfolio in React!
